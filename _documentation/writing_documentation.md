# Creating a new documentation page

A new page for your documentation project can be made simply by copying and renaming the `project_post_template.md` file located in `_templates` to your local project directory.

```bash
cd ~/RnD
cp _templates/project_post_template.md _my-project/page.md
```

Then edit the front matter within the new file to properly reflect the title of the page. Note that this title is also what is shown in the table of contents on your project's landing page.

# Updating the project's table of contents

By default, a table of contents is generated linking to every separate markdown file within a project's directory (excluding the about page). This is fine if order of presentation does not matter. If, on the more likely hand, you want a table of contents that presents pages in a specific order, then a simple modifcation to the about file's front matter is all that is needed.

Simply open the about.md file for your project and add a `toc` variable:

```yaml
---
layout: page
title: About
toc:
 - Setting Up A Local Documentation Copy
 - Making a New Project
 - Writing Documentation
 - Markdown
---
```

This will create a table of contents with **only the pages specified by `toc` and only if there is a page with a matching title.**

For example, if your project directory has the following layout

```
_my-project
 about.md
 page1.md #Title of "This is page one"
 page2.md #Title of "This is page two"
 page3.md #Title of "This is actually page four"
```


and a `toc` specified by

```yaml
---
layout: page
title: About
toc:
 - This is page one
 - This is page two
 - This is page three
 - This is page four
---
```

The resulting table of contents that is generated would be 


[This is page one](writing_documentation.md)

[This is page two](writing_documentation.md)


# Adding images and linking to other pages

Since this is markdown, [the usual markdown conventions apply](markdown.md).

A special behavior though is linking to other markdown pages on the site. Since this is hosted by github pages and built by jekyll, [relative linking is in effect](https://blog.github.com/2016-12-05-relative-links-for-github-pages/)

Assuming this structure

~~~
├── _my_collection
│   ├── some_doc.md
│   └── some_subdir
│       └── another_doc.md
├── _config.yml
└── index.md
~~~

the following will work:

File | Link
-|-
`index.md` | `[Some Doc](_my_collection/some_doc.md)`
`index.md` | `[Another Doc](_my_collection/some_subdir/another_doc.md)`
`_my_collection/some_doc.md` | `[Index](../index.md)`
`_my_collection/some_doc.md` | `[Another Doc](some_subdir/another_doc.md)`
`_my_collection/some_subdir/another_doc.md` | `[Index](../../index.md)`
`_my_collection/some_subdir/another_doc.md` | `[Some Doc](../some_doc.md)`


Images can be inserted using standard markdown:

```markdown
 ![Image](src)
```

Where src can be either an online url or another relative path. If you have many images localy, consider creating an `images` or `figures` folder within your project folder to contain them.
